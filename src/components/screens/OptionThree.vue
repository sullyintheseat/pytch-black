      <p>With our proprietary platform teams and sponsors now have the ability to send real-time offers directly to a fans mobile device throughout an entire event. The best part is that the fan only needs to scan our digital seat tag one time in order to have the ability to receive continued updates and offers. It is important to remember that these offers can be sent down to an individual seat or device level, so if brands only want to make an offer to the premium seats or even a specific row or section then that is what they can now do!</p>
